# Overview

My software is a simple grocery list program. It interacts with a goodle firestore database to hold the information. In order to use this program you need the python file and then you can view your list for each store that you might visit. You can add, update, delete or read from the list. 

The purpose of this software was to practice interacting with a cloud database. I wanted to have a program that could add, delete, and modify data in an online database.

# Cloud Database

The cloud database that I decided to use was a google firestore database. It is convenient to use and easy to learn as well as being free!

The structure of the database is not complex. It is a NoSQL database and so is set up in a format very similar to JSON. The basic layout is the GroceryList->Stores->Items.
# Development Environment

I used visual studio code and python to write the code to interact with this database.

I had to import firebase admin and a few other things from that library to be able to interact with the database from the code.

# Future Work

* Create a more seamless way to interact with the list so it feels more efficient and benefical to other options.
* Have it accessible across multiple devices so the benefit of the cloud database can be fully exploited.
* Utilize some sort of GUI to increase user satisfaction.
